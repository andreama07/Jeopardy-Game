//This is a list of where the specific project requirements can be found in my code
public class Project_Requirements {
	/* 
	 * These are a few specific lines where each requirement can be seen, not every instance it's used:
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 1a Line 11 in Main class
	 * 1b Lines 11, and 110 in Game class (involves a double array)
	 * 1c Line 21 in Game class (while loop condition)
	 * 1d Line 28 in Main class (asks for user's name)
	 * 
	 * 2) Line 8-19 in Display class 
	 * 			(one constructor has 2 set values for a static variable, the other constructor randomizes a value)	
	 * 3) Lines 22-26 in Display class 
	 * 			(printing the introduction to the game)
	 * 4) Lines 59-100 in Game class 
	 * 			(uses the key parameter to ask question and check answer)
	 * 5) ^same as #4 
	 * 			(method returns 1 if the user's guess was correct and 0 is it was wrong)
	 * 6) Line 46 in Game class 
	 * 			(combines user's chosen category and point value to make the key)
	 * 7) Lines 68-69 in Display class 
	 * 			(uses substring to get category and point value from the key)
	 * 8) Line 7 and 186 in Game class 
	 * 			(String ArrayList used to keep track of unasked questions)
	 * 9) Lines 197, 198, and 200 
	 * 			(Math.random() and Math.round() used for a question)
	 * 10) Line 43 in Main class 
	 * 			(checks if user lost or won)
	 * 11) Lines 64-99 in Game class 
	 * 			(checks if the answer can be checked by comparing strings or if another method needs to be called, then determines which method needs to be used)
	 * 12) I thought I could use the dangling else in Lines 154-154, but it's actually unnecessary
	 * 13) Line 137 in Game class 
	 * 			(checks if user's guess fulfills both of the question requirements)
	 * 14) Didn't use this
	 * 15) Line 89 in Game class 	
	 * 			(checks if user's guess is the same as the HashMap answer)
	 * 16) Lines 36-42 in Main class 
	 * 			(loops the game while the user still has 3 lives and hasn't reached the goal yet)
	 * 17) Lines 71-75 in Display class
	 * 			(uses a for loop to find the index of the point value in the numbers array)
	 * 18) Lines 6-7 in User class
	 * 			(the user's lives and score, public so that they can be used in Main class as conditions)
	 * 19) Lines 15-17 in Game class
	 * 			(constructor that gets passed a Scanner so that input can be read in the Game class too)
	 * 20) Lines 12-15 in User class
	 * 			(prints out the # of lives left, # of point earned, and target # of points to win)
	 * 21) Lines 18-25
	 * 			(updates the lives and points based on whether the answer was answered correctly or not)
	 * 22) Line 5 in User class
	 * 			(goal of the game; could be not-static but it's more specific to the class and not the object)
	 * 23) Lines 56-62 in Display class
	 * 			(uses 2 for loops to print the 2D array into the console)
	 * 24) Line 50 in Game class
	 * 			(removes the question that is about to be asked from the unasked questions ArrayList)
	 * 25) Lines 108-116
	 * 			(insertion sorts a double array for a math question)
	 *
